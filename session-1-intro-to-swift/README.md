Welcome to Hack Sprint, Winter '22! The goal of this workshop series is to teach you the fundamental skills for iOS Development in Swift so that by the end, you'll be able to make your own iOS applications and have a good starting point for the rest of your mobile development journey!

Please note that, unfortunately, developing iOS apps is restricted to machines running MacOS as of the date of this workshop. If you don't own a Mac device, one option is to use [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/). This *is* a paid service, but if you want to try iOS development immediately, this is a quick solution.

This session is more of an introductory view to what we'll be covering for the rest of the quarter, but it definitely has some concepts that you can learn and start applying immediately. Let's start!

## What is Swift?

### History and Introduction
Let's take a look into the past, back when telephone booths were first invented... just kidding! But we don't have to go too far back to remember a time when "mobile" devices used to just refer to phones. Now, we have a LOT of devices under this category: phones, tablets, smart watches, and so on. Thus, when we refer to **mobile development**, we're referring to building applications for **on-the-go devices**.

The applications we build can be built using languages and tools that are *native*, or those that are *cross-platform*. **Native** refers to using one language to write for one device or OS type. Thus, the code you write for an Android phone, for example, wouldn't be compatible with a Windows phone or iPhone. The benefits of this are that you get higher performance, since the language is built and supported to be run on that platform, and sometimes getting in the respective app stores is easier. The downside is that if you want to deploy your app on many different devices, you would have to rewrite the code with new technology each time! On the other side there is **cross-platform** development, which refers to using one language for many devices. This results in an app that is much easier to lanch on multiple platforms, and to maintain, since it only requires one codebase. The negatives of this is that optimizing performance on these apps can be difficult, and sometimes there isn't strong support for UI/UX tools. This isn't to say one is better than the other, though! There are tradeoffs to consider, and it really depends on what you want to do for your app. Swift, which is what we'll be using, is a *native* language.
